This web application is created to give you random images of cats. Simply write any specific quality tags you want your cat to have, or have it be a gif, then submit and you will see a random picture of a cat.  
## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

## Explanation

My form contains two inputs, if you either want it as a gif or whether you want tags on a specific type of cat. When submitted the API accesses a random image of a cat following the specific tags or if the gif is checked it will show a gif. This is using React components with, CatForm being the main content component.
